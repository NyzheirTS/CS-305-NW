1.Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Due to the nature of their dealings Artemis Financial deals with sensitive customer information such as SSN, Bank Accounts, Retirement Accounts, and Investment Accounts.  It is of utmost importance that Artemis Financial maintain client trust by avoiding security breaches and enforcing the highest level of scrutiny when it comes to customer protection and security. Artemis Financials has also expressed the desire to modernize their operations, a step towards achieving this included incorporating new technology such as WebSocket’s and Serverless computing.


2.What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

  After identifying the clients software security vulnerabilities I created a mitigation plan which explained all of the aspects of secure coding and how it applied to their system. It is very important to take security seriously in order to give users confidence when using your application. Software security and proper practices should be at the top of every companies priority list as it oftentimes when overlooked leads to catastrophic effects for companies and their customers. 

3.Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  Properly Identifying, explaining, and documenting  CVEs in a professional way and correctly identifying false positives in the dependency check report was difficult for me. 

4.How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  In order to increase the layers of security on the application I looked at the goal of the application then referenced the vulnerability workflow sheets to see what potential areas applied to the application and implemented solutions to confirm these. In the future I will use tools such as Maven Dependency Check and other third party tools to make sure my application is properly secured.   

5.How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I made sure that the code was functional and secure after refactoring by performing multiple tests against the system including making sure the code compiled and executed without errors as well as additional static testing to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

6.What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - Maven Dependency Check
  - NVE database
  - Other Secure Coding Practices such as Input Validation


7.Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I think this project displays my understanding of the areas of secure coding as well as describing my thought process for working through software to address security concerns.
